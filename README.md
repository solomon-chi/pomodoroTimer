This is a simple Pomodoro Timer built with React. It allows you to start, pause, and reset a 25-minute timer, commonly used for the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method.

## Features

-   **Start/Pause:** Toggles the timer on and off.
-   **Reset:** Resets the timer to 25 minutes.
-   **Time Display:** Shows the remaining time in minutes and seconds.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```


### Running the Application

1.  Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```

2.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

-   Click the "Start" button to begin the 25-minute timer.
-   Click the "Pause" button to stop the timer.
-   Click the "Reset" button to reset the timer to 25 minutes.

## Code Explanation

-   **`useState`:** Manages the timer's current time (`time`) and its running state (`isRunning`).
-   **`useEffect`:** Sets up an interval to decrement the timer every second when `isRunning` is true. It also clears the interval when `isRunning` is false or the component unmounts.
-   **`formatTime`:** Converts the remaining seconds into a `minutes:seconds` format.
-   **Component Structure:**
    -   A `pomodoro-container` div wraps the entire timer.
    -   A `pomodoro-title` displays the title.
    -   A `timer-display` shows the formatted time.
    -   A `timer-controls` div contains the "Start/Pause" and "Reset" buttons.
-   **CSS:** The `index.css` file provides basic styling for the timer.

## Customization

-   You can change the initial timer duration by modifying the initial value of the `time` state in the `useState` hook.
-   You can customize the styling by modifying the `index.css` file.
-   You can add additional features, such as different timer lengths (e.g., short break, long break), sound notifications, or visual indicators.
